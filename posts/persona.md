<p>As part of the requirements of completing the For The Women (FTW) Foundation Data Science Program, scholars were divided into groups with a data science practitioner as a mentor for the capstone project. Since real-world data from the sponsor companies were used, real-time communication and collaboration was required. Our team was assigned to analyze and create a customer segmentation for a health maintenance organization to be able to help them in their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>We were given the company's sales and membership data from 2019 to 2022. Data analysis was done through Excel, Python, and Tableau. Using K-Means Clustering, we were able to identify three personas based on their age, gender, civil status, location, and transaction history.</p>
